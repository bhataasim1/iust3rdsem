# OOPS IN C++ Chapter 5 Assignment
## Chapter 5 : Functions
### Below are the Questions.

1) Refer to the CIRCAREA program in Chapter 2, “C++ Programming Basics.” Write a function called _circarea()_ that finds the area of a circle in a similar way. It should take an argument of type float and return an argument of the same type. Write a _main()_ function that gets a radius value from the user, calls _circarea()_, and displays the result.

2) Raising a number _n_ to a _power p_ is the same as multiplying _n_ by itself _p_ times. Write a function called _power()_ that takes a _double_ value for _n_ and an _int value for p_, and returns the result as a _double value_. Use a default argument of 2 for _p_, so that if this argument is omitted, the number _n_ will be squared. Write a _main()_ function that gets values from the user to test this function.

3) Write a function called _zeroSmaller()_ that is passed two int arguments by reference and then sets the smaller of the two numbers to 0. Write a _main()_ program to exercise this function.

4) Write a function that takes two Distance values as arguments and returns the larger one. Include a *_main()_* program that accepts two Distance values from the user, compares them, and displays the larger. (See the RETSTRC program for hints.)

5) Write a function called _hms_to_secs()_ that takes three int values—for _hours, minutes, and seconds_ —as arguments, and returns the equivalent time in _seconds (type long)_. Create a program that exercises this function by repeatedly obtaining a time value in hours, minutes, and seconds from the user (_format 12:59:59_), calling the function, and displaying the value of _seconds_ it returns.
