# OOPS IN C++ Chapter 5 Assignment
## Chapter 5 : Functions
### Below are the Questions.

1) Refer to the CIRCAREA program in Chapter 2, “C++ Programming Basics.” Write a function called _circarea()_ that finds the area of a circle in a similar way. It should take an argument of type float and return an argument of the same type. Write a _main()_ function that gets a radius value from the user, calls _circarea()_, and displays the result.
2) Raising a number _n_ to a _power p_ is the same as multiplying _n_ by itself _p_ times. Write a function called _power()_ that takes a _double_ value for _n_ and an _int value for p_, and returns the result as a _double value_. Use a default argument of 2 for _p_, so that if this argument is omitted, the number _n_ will be squared. Write a _main()_ function that gets values from the user to test this function.
