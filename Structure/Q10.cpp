/*
Create a structure called sterling that stores money amounts in the old-style British system discussed in Exercises 8 and 11 in Chapter 3, “Loops and Decisions.” 
The members could be called pounds , shillings , and pence , all of type int . 
The program should ask the user to enter a money amount in new-style decimal pounds (type double ), convert it to the old-style system, 
store it in a variable of type struct sterling , and then display this amount in pounds-shillings-pence format.
