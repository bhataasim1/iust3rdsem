# Aassignment 4 OOPS C++ Lab 
## Recursion 

1) A palindrome consists of a word or deblanked, unpunctuated phrase that is spelled exactly the same when the letters are reversed. Write a recursive function that returns a value of 1 if its string argument is a palindrome. Notice that in palindromes such as ___level, deed, sees, and Madam Iâ€™m Adam (madamimadam)___,the first letter matches the last, the second matches the next-to-last, and so on.

2) Write and test a recursive function that returns the value of the following recursive definition:
<pre> f ( x ) = 0 if x 0
 f ( x ) = f ( x -1) + 2 </pre>
   otherwise What set of numbers is generated by this definition?

3) Write a recursive C function that counts the number of vowels in a string.

4) Explain the use of a stack in recursion.

5) Which is generally more efficient, recursion or iteration?

6) Which control statement do you typically find in a recursive function?
